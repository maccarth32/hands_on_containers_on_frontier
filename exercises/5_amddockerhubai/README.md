In this exercise, create an AMD dockerhub Jax image and use it in running a 4 node Jax `Gaussian process regression` test. Use the latest tagged jax image from the AMD dockerhub. 

Obtain the Jax test from the Jax repo [here](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/tree/main/) and access the `gaussian_process_regression` test from the `examples` directory. 

You can either copy the files within the Jax test repo you cloned into the container and run from within the container or have the files on the host like in this sections tensorflow example.
